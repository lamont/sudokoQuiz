sudokoQuiz
==========

a sudoko puzzle solver in ruby

Back in 2005 or so, I was learning ruby and attempted this quiz:

http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz43.html

My "solution" 

* never worked
* used a 2d array and various clever math tricks to operate on cells
* was hard to read
* had a bunch of nested for loops.

I've been doing a lot more ruby lately and wanted to revisit this and refactor it in a more object oriented style, with the idea that I could make the complicated expressions more readable and eliminate nested for loops.

It's not fast, it's just meant to be readable and extendable as a programming exercise.

Someday I'll look at the quiz answers, but I'd like to solve this properly once.
