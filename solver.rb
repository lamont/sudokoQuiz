  # methods for solving a sudoko quiz that I know

  # simplify! does the basic solve in Board to find cells with only one possible answer

  # guess_at_two should attempt to find 2 cells in a row/column/grid which have only two (identical)
  #  possible values. Then remove those two from all other zones of influence to see if we have any
  #  new single-value solutions appear
